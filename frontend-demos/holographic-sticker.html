        <h1>Holographic sticker</h1>
        <p>Sparrows are small, lively birds that have adapted well to urban environments. Their lifespan varies
            depending on species and habitat, but in the wild, they typically live <b>between 2 to 5 years.</b> Some
            individuals can exceed this range under favorable conditions, and in captivity, they may live up to <b>10
                years or more.</b>
        </p>
        <p>These birds belong to the </b>Passeridae family</b>, with the house sparrow <b>(Passer domesticus)</b> being
            one of the most familiar species. They thrive in diverse environments, from bustling city streets to remote
            countryside areas. Sparrows are known for their adaptability, often nesting in buildings and feeding on
            seeds, grains, and small insects.

            Their survival is influenced by factors such as <b>predation, disease, food availability, and habitat
                quality.</b> Urban sparrows face threats like pollution and loss of nesting sites, while wild sparrows
            must evade predators such as birds of prey and domestic cats. Despite these challenges, their resilience and
            ability to coexist with humans make them one of the most widespread bird species.

        <h2>Social Behavior</h2>
        <p>Sparrows are highly social creatures, often forming <strong>flocks</strong> to forage, roost, and defend
            territory. They engage in <strong>chirping and calling</strong>, using vocalizations to communicate about
            food, danger, or mating.</p>

        <h2>Feeding Habits</h2>
        <p>Sparrows primarily eat <strong>seeds, grains, fruits, and small insects</strong>. Their diet varies depending
            on habitatâ€”urban sparrows rely on discarded food, while rural sparrows feed on natural grains and insects.
        </p>

        <h2>Mating & Nesting</h2>
        <p>During mating season, male sparrows perform <strong>chirping displays and feather puffing</strong> to attract
            females. They are <strong>monogamous</strong>, often staying with one mate for the season. They build nests
            in <strong>tree cavities, buildings, rooftops, and air vents</strong> using grass, twigs, feathers, and
            paper scraps.</p>

        <h2>Flight & Mobility</h2>
        <p>Sparrows have a <strong>fluttering flight</strong> style with rapid wingbeats, allowing them to maneuver well
            in tight spaces. Unlike larger birds that glide, sparrows rely on <strong>quick hops and short
                flights</strong> to navigate their environment.</p>

        <h2>Predators & Survival</h2>
        <p>Sparrows face threats from <strong>hawks, cats, snakes, and environmental challenges</strong> like pollution
            and habitat loss. Their ability to hide in dense bushes and buildings helps them survive harsh conditions.
        </p>

        <h2>Fun Fact!</h2>
        <p>Sparrows take <strong>dust baths</strong> instead of water baths to keep their feathers clean. They fluff up
            and wiggle in dry soil or sand, removing parasites and maintaining their plumage.</p>
